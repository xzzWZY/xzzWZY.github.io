### ML.ENERGY.LEADERBOARD
May 2023 – Sept. 2023; Symbiotic Lab
- Developed the [ML.ENERGY Leaderboard](https://ml.energy/leaderboard/?__theme=light), an open-source platform for benchmarking the energy efficiency and NLP performance of LLM models.
- Defined performance metrics and implemented scripts for optimized batched inference to ensure accurate measurement.
- Contributed to the online Chatbot Arena which gathers data on models' energy consumption and performance.

### OS project

### Out-of-order Execution Pipeline for the MIPS R10K Microprocessor
- Developed an out-of-order execution pipeline with six stages on the MIPS R10K microprocessor.
- Implemented key components including register renaming, reservation station, reorder buffer, and a common data bus for enhanced parallelism.
- Leveraged Tomasulo’s algorithm to achieve dynamic scheduling and mitigate pipeline stalls.
- Added a Load Store Queue and a Branch Target Buffer to further optimize execution efficiency and improve instruction throughput.

### Video Streaming via CDN
- Built a proxy server to handle video streaming for multiple clients and servers, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- Implemented adaptive bitrate streaming to minimize buffering and enhance user experience based on real-time network conditions.
- Used DNS load balancing with round-robin and distance-based server selection, utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm to optimize server choices based on proximity and load.
