# Research
### Improving Service Level Objective (SLO) of Large Language Model Serving
July 2024 - present; Supervisor: [Fan Lai](https://www.fanlai.me/) @ GAEA Lab
- Classify LLM serving requests into three categories based on system objectives: latency-intensive, throughput-intensive, and bulk requests.
- Define Service Level Objectives (SLO) for each request type.
- Develop an SLO-aware scheduling policy using length prediction to optimize job completion time (JCT) and improve user experience in LLM inference.

### Defining and Enhancing Quality-of-Experience in LLM Serving
May 2023 – April 2024; Supervisor: [Mosharaf Chowdhury](https://www.mosharaf.com/) @ Symbiotic Lab
- Identified that in LLM text-streaming services, systems must generate faster than user reading speed to enhance user experience, addressing gaps in previous metrics.
- Defined Quality of Experience (QoE) in LLM serving.
- Formulated the problem as a knapsack optimization and developed a scheduling algorithm to maximize QoE in online LLM serving.
- Built LLM serving system Andes on top of vLLM, integrating the scheduling algorithm.
- Co-authored the paper “Andes: Defining and Enhancing Quality-of-Experience in LLM-Based Text Streaming Services” as the second author.


# Projects
### ML.ENERGY.LEADERBOARD
May 2023 – Sept. 2023; Symbiotic Lab
- Developed the ML.ENERGY Leaderboard, an open-source platform for benchmarking the energy efficiency and NLP performance of LLM models.
- Defined performance metrics and implemented scripts for optimized batched inference to ensure accurate measurement.
- Contributed to the online Chatbot Arena which gathers data on models' energy consumption and performance.
